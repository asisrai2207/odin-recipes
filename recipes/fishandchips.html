    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serve this beer-battered fish over a bed of salt and vinegar chips with tartar sauce and lemon. 
        Virtually every beer-battered fish recipe looks crispy coming out of the fryer, and some even stay crispy for a few minutes, but then the inevitable sogginess sets in. With this simple formula and a few easy tricks, your last bite will be as crisp as your first. 
        The keys are keeping the batter really cold and patting the fish completely dry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Fish</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the batter: Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Finish the batter: Remove flour mixture from the freezer. Pour in beer and whisk until batter is the consistency of a thick pancake batter, adding more beer as needed.</li>
        <li>Fry cod in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.</li>
